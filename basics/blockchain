System of recording transaction.
These transactions are recorded on a public ledger and 
this legder is distributed accross different nodes on the 
network


How transactions work. Each user has an address 
an address is a public key with associated private key.

public key: bank account number.
private key: password of your bank account.

To authorise the transaction you have to sign a digital signature. A way of 
proving that you have a private key corresponding to the public key without
having to reveal the private key.

After authorizing the transaction the node you are connected on announces the 
transaction to the bitcoin network.

Then the miners take that transaction with others and make ablock 

a block = transactions +  previous block identifier + proof of work
proof of work = mathematical problem to solve. 

Then the miner who solves the problem gets rewarded. thats the only way
the bitcoin is created(mining rewards).

The double spending problem this problem arises if you track transactions
with a ledger. Some malicious actors can manipulate the ledger.

In real world if you transact then the possession = ownership

In ledger world possession != ownership. It's only on papers.

Blockchain = public ledger of all bitcoin transactions.
Transactions added on a blockchain are being processed by computer nodes on 
a network .

Transactions are chained in chronological order.

Ethereum ecosystem no need of central entity. develop decentralized systems
and make the code public to achive trustworthy.

blockchain is part of web3.0 evolution of the internet.

web3.0
connective intelligence
connecting data
concept applications
ultimately people

achived by blockchain. => shared ledger no blocking.

Why can't business documents be shared instead of getting transfered.
