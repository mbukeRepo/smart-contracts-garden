Install metamask to experiment and develop applications on top of ethereum network

don't use ethereum network use test networks to experiment with free tokens.
to get free tokens use a faucet.

you need a blockchain node to interact with the blockchain 

   metamask => Infura (service with blockchain) => blockchain node.
  (how we get free eths from a test network) faucet => backend (with private and public key to sign transaction) => blockchain node
