Accounts and signing

web3.eth.signTransaction({from, to, value}) => {v, r, s}

Transaction.
Private key(RANDOM 32 bit characters).
<--
Private => ECDSA => Public key (64 key) => Ethereum account(Keccak hash of
last 20 bytes of the public key)

Transaction + Private key => Signed transaction
Signed Transaction(ECRecover) => Ethereum account + Public key.
-->

Key points
Transaction signature ensure authenticity.
Signatures are generated from private keys.
public keys and addresses are generated from private keys and you can not reverse
it.

Keep you private key secure.

Cryptographic hashing.

Input => Hashing => Output.
It's irreversible.
It's one to one. every same input result into exact output.
Change in input result in different output.
